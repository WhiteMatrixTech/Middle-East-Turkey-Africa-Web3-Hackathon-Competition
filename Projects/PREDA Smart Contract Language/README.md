	Team Name:PREDA Smart Contract Language
	Job Allocation:
	Project Intro:PREDA is a new programming language for developing parallel smart contracts on sharding blockchains with Solidity compatibility and interoperability. Based on an innovative distributed programming model with functional relay semantics and programmable sharding schemes, the PREDA language is devoted to scaling out blockchains that support general smart contracts independently of sharding architectures and consensus algorithms.
