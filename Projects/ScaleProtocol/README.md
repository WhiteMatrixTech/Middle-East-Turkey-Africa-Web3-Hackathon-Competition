- Project Intro: Scale is an enhanced perpetual contract of financial derivatives including multiply Assets, like Commodities, FX, Crypto, etc., with 0 commission. The new Dealer Price Feeds(DPF) model we developed will provide unlimited market depth to make decentralised derivatives trading fast, convenient and stable. As a team with centralised trading system developing experience, we are finishing building the alpha testing version on Sui with Pyth Oracle. Through Scale, we want to lower the threshold for on-chain derivatives trading and allow more traders to participate in promoting the healthy development of the crypto industry.
