**Project Intro**
1984. In the neon-drenched streets of Jade City, a battle is raging between the city's elite detectives and a ruthless gang of crooks. As the detectives race against time to track down the gang and put an end to their reign of terror, they must use their cunning and expertise to outmaneuver their foes and bring them to justice. But the crooks are no ordinary gang, and they will stop at nothing to claim victory in this thrilling game of death. Can the detectives rise to the challenge and save Jade City from the brink of chaos, or will the crooks prove too powerful to stop?

Only time will tell in this universe of deception and betrayal.

Ultraverse is a metaverse allowing absolute freedom for participants yet to choose a faction - in a very hostile environment. Where resources are scarce, the map is limited and this concrete jungle can kill your avatar from traffic, armed crooks or your own faction detectives with friendly fire. Being playable on Android or your WebGL 2.0 enabled browser and even direct Metamask Mobile App integration or through the browser extension - but not restricted to Web3 gameplay only! Use the simple controls to play - either the virtual joypad on your phone or use WASD keys for navigation, LMB (Attack) and RMB (Block), Space (Jump). Avatars can choose to use their fists, guns or katanas, allowing close range combat, mid-range sword fighting or long range shooting to take out other players.
